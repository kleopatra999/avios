#--- This process serves one request then exits as HTTP does not use
#--- a continuous connection system. A process will be spawned for
#--- every browser connect. This server is very simple and simply
#--- serves files and hence it will not accept any sort of input from 
#--- the browser nor will it serve binary gif/jpeg/java files due to the
#--- way Avios works though it works fine with Ascii Javascript code.
