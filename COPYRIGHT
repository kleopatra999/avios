                       *** COPYRIGHT AND RESTRICTIONS ***

This software is provided as is. It could and probably does have some minor
bugs and I will not guarantee its reliability for long term non-stop operation
and hence because of this I accept no liability for any problems that may
arise from you using it. 

    The Avios source code is copyright to me (Neil Robertson) but it is
Freeware (NOT public domain) which means you can distribute it to anyone you 
wish PROVIDING you stick to the restrictions that I make which is that you have 
not modified the server source code (the whole point of Avios is that you code 
in AviosPL, you do not alter the C code making up the server) as I DO NOT want 
modified/hacked versions circulating. You are also NOT permitted to sell the 
server source code or any files that come with it in its distribution tar file 
but you can use Avios to run a pay to use system.
     
    All AviosPL programs distributed with the server are also freeware and
as such the same restrictions apply to them as to the server code except
that I'm not too bothered if you distribute modified versions as long as you
don't try to sell these versions.

    You are free to distribute any programs you write in AviosPL and since 
you are the author of them their copyright belongs to you which means you can 
sell them.
    
    I ask for no royalties on either pay-to-use systems run by Avios or on
any AviosPL programs you have written that you sell.
