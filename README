This is a patch distribution. You will need to download avios152.tar.gz first
and unpack it before you copy these files into the directory and run the 
"runme" script. You system must have the patch command available, if not then 
either try and download a copy or email me and I can send you the full source 
code for Avios 1.5.3.

The extra_CHANGELOG file is the new part of the CHANGELOG file that came with 
1.5.2 and the extra_command file is info about the new "tidy" command that is 
to be added to the DOCS/commands files.

Neil Robertson, August 1998.
