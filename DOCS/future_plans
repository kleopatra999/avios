                       *** PLANS FOR THE FUTURE ***

Things that will get done:
   Nested include files.
   Commands split over multiple lines
   Support for floating point numbers.
   Extra maths commands.
   Fix binary gif and jpeg download so allowing full blown web server.
   Bug fixing (if there are any, ahem :)


Things that will get done eventually:
   Auto reboot of failed terminal/background processes.
   Create a central message queue for all processes.
   Optimise code a more (eg: ditch main command switch statement and 
                             replace with function pointers)


An idea on the horizon: 
   Allow processes to create a new image process to sit on a new port.
   Write an AviosPL program that can transfer other AviosPL programs between
      Avios systems so allowing net crawlers and bots.


Yeah right, keeping taking the pills:
   Bribe Sun and Oracle who'll then ditch the JavaVM and back Avios making
   me a millionaire in the process :)
