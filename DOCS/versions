The Avios version number consists of 3 fields. The major , minor and patch
levels. eg: 1.0.0 , means major version 1, minor version 0 and patch level
0. If a small bug fix or some minor change has been done to the code then
I'll up the patch level. If new features have been added or old ones changed
drastically then I'll up the minor version number. If however the code has had
a complete rewrite then I'll up the major version number.
