Include files are loaded by placing &<filename> in the main process file.
eg: &rdesc

They may contain anything that the main file may contain including the 
main procedure itself so long as it isn't duplicated anywhere else.
For this release of Avios (1.0.0) only one level of include file nesting is
permitted but I hope to be able to lift this restriction for the next 
release.
