Include files are loaded by placing &<filename> in the main process file.
eg: &roomdata

They may contain anything that the main file may contain including the 
main procedure itself so long as it isn't duplicated anywhere else.
Include files can be nested , the level of nesting has a soft limit set
by the MAX_INCLUDE_LEVELS macro in the header file.
