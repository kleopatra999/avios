<h1>Avios HTML test pages</h1>
This is simply to demonstrate how Avios can be used as a simple web

binary files which rules out gifs , jpegs and Java stuff but as you can see 
from the examples is happy with Javascript files. The javascript programs I 
took from my own home page which is <a href="http://www.ogham.demon.co.uk/neil.html">here.</a>
