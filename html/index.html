<h1>Avios HTML test pages</h1>
This is simply to demonstrate how Avios can be used as a simple web 
server. It cannot however download any binary files as it is an ascii line
based system which rules out gifs , jpegs and Java stuff but as you can see 
from the example it is happy with Javascript files. The javascript program I 
took from my own home page which is <a href="http://www.ogham.demon.co.uk/neil.html">here</a> 
or <a href="another.html">here</a> is another test page.
